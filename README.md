# Glycemic-Project üçö
A project on Glycemic Index that I have worked on involving bioinformatics.

## Procedure/Steps
Run "R_UtilityScripts_Malcolm.R", then run "20210827 Glycemic-Prelim Analysis 4.R".
- Statistical test results and plots will be produced. More detailed explanation of each set of plots or data are in the respective folders.

## About the Data üí°
The data I have been using had been obtained from blood samples acquired from subjects involved in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) test by Dr Sumanto Haldar and his team. The analysis is a follow-up from the following study:
- [High or low glycemic index (GI) meals at dinner results in greater postprandial glycemia compared with breakfast: a randomized controlled trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202752/)

The blood samples were analyzed by an Agilent 6495C Triple Quadrupole LCMS by Dr Leroy S. Pakkiri in Dr Chester Drum's Lab in the National University of Singapore (NUS). The raw data output (.m) from the LCMS were then converted to .mzML files and processed by the [MRMkit program](https://github.com/cssblab/MRMkit) by the 
Computational & Statistical Systems Biology Laboratory (CSSBLab) for automated peak detection and integration of the MS output. The program also corrects for batch and column variances that may arise from the usage of different 96-well plates and columns in the LCMS.

The resulting output data from MRMkit (Eg. _quant tables_) have been well-checked through for potential machine/procedural biases and are then supplemented with relevant metadata that help to categorize subjects for analysis.

## Contrasts of Interests üîÑ
Each subject are measured under 4 circumstances, each across 5 time points. Each subject will have thus have 20 samples in total. The statuses/classifications that each subject adopt are coded as such:
- A: P-E
- B: P-F
- C: Q-E
- D: Q-F

We seek to analyze the metabolite contrasts between subjects of status P and Q, as well as between E and F. Subsequently, we can look at the contrasts between P-E and P-F, Q-E and Q-F, P-E and Q-E, and P-F and Q-F.

## Input Files Required üìÅ
1. 20210817_quant_table_glycemic.txt
  - This is the quant_table output from MRMkit supplemented with relevant categorical metadata. It will be the main data file that is used throughout the analysis.
2. quant_table_pre_correction.txt
  - Should we omit the column correction factor in the MRMkit run, the data here will contain column variance, which may skew the analysis.
  - This quant_table dataset is required for comparison to ensure quality control of the dataset to be used.

## R Scripts üíª
1. 20210827 Glycemic-Prelim Analysis 4.R
  - This script will take the 2 inputs files above and perform the necessary statistical analyses and plotting with the help of the the utility functions in the scrip tbelow.
2. R_UtilityScripts_Malcolm.R
  - A script containing functions that are customized towards manipulating the data structure of the quant_table outputs of MRMkit and the data output by the Agilent software.
  - *Run this script first* to load the necessary functions before going through the script named "20210827 Glycemic-Prelim Analysis 4.R".
